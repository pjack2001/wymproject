# Opensource Solution

Opensource Solution for companies and teams.

## Wiki & Design

Gollum wiki system, which is built on top of Git and can store the history change.

Gollum pages can be written in a variety of formats such as `markdown`. You can edit your wiki page through the built-in web interface or by using your favorite text editor or IDE. 

## Code & Review

Gerrit Code Review system, which is a web based code review system, facilitating online code reviews for projects using the Git version control system.

## Continuous integration

Jenkins CI, which is an extensible open source continuous integration server.

After you submit your patch, you need to do some basic check or automation test(unit test) before merge it to code repository. It is the Jenkins time!

The github code can use Travis CI.

## Bug & Tracking

Bugzilla, which is a "Defect Tracking System" or "Bug-Tracking System". Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively.

## Git hosting

Gitlab is a good opensource solution for Git hosting, it is very like Github. I am very like it.
