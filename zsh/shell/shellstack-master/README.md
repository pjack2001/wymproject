ShellStack
=====

ShellStack is a set of shell scripts that I've been collecting and creating to ease the installation of applications.

At this time, my daily working environment is based on Ubuntu Linux, therefore all scripts should work on the latest LTS versions.

Recipes
-----

Although you can use ShellStack's files separately, it has some pre cooked recipes to expedite server setup. Currently there are basically three recipes:

* basic - installs a current and secure basic box with some essential packages on it
* wordpress - install a production ready WP environment for users that have heavy traffic needs
* rails - installs a Ruby on Rails ready box based on Basic with production ready capabilities

Usage
-----

You can just source `shellstack.sh` file to source all the script files and call the functions inside the lib directory or you can also use one of the recipes listed above by issuing on terminal:

`./install <recipe>`

Motivation
-----

As a big [Linode](http://linode.com) fan, and understanding that their StackScript platform is too simple to keep complex scripts on a form field I decided to organize things better with a git project with good file separation and keep a bare minimum of scripting inside the StackScript just to clone the git repository and fire installation. You can find the scripts [here](http://www.linode.com/stackscripts/browse/?ss_keyword=fagiani)
